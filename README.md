👋 Introduction
Welcome to my 3D interactive portfolio, a web-based experience crafted with care using modern JavaScript technologies and voxel-style visuals. This portfolio isn't just a place to list my work—it's a project in itself.

Built with Three.js, React, and Framer Motion, it reflects my passion for creating immersive, responsive, and creative user experiences. Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or curious visitor—this portfolio invites you to explore who I am, what I build, and how I think.
